                <p>
                        Hello, my name is Kalonte Jackson-Tate. I am currently a senior at the University of Central Florida where I am majoring in Computer Science. 
                        I have a strong interest in software development on both desktop and mobile platforms. With Orlando being one of the 
                        most technologically innovative cities in Florida, I feel UCF is be the best place for me to learn more about the tech industry and 
                        broaden my horizons.
                        
                </p>
                <p>
                        So, as far as programming languages go, I'm most proficient with C and Java and have completed many projects with both. I'm familiar with using both IDEs such as Visual Studio 
                        and Netbeans and text editors such as Sublime and Atom to write code. I am also currently building a project written in JavaScript and have knowledge of React Native. I'm familiar with 
                        node.JS, mongoDB, Restful API, AWS, HTML, CSS, and SQL. I also have experience in technical writing and feel comfortable translating computer 
                        jargon into something the average user can understand. I have an intermediate level of understanding of project management and developing projects in an agile environment.
